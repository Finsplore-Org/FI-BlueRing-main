## Group Commitments
In this section, your aim is to come up with shared responses and solutions for managing different
obstacles that might arise. This is your main set of contract commitments.  
Under key headings, we have provided some examples of potential issues that might arise. Feel to adjust
them and create your own in the spaces provided to suit your group and project. You should make sure to
include the obstacles you identified in Part 1.  
Write out your approach to addressing each potential issue in the second column, then respond to the
prompts below the table.  
When coming up with responses, think about how your values will help you to address these obstacles and
reach your destination. For instance, if your group values fairness, then your responses/solutions may
involve issuing a vote to the group on how to resolve an issue.  
### Communication
| Potential issue  | Response |
|-------|-------|
| Group members disagree about a course of action | Hold a structured discussion where all members present their perspectives. Final decision by majority vote, documented in Confluence. |
| Group member(s) are being rude or dismissive to other group member(s) | Address the behaviour immediately in a team meeting. Reaffirm respect as a core value. Repeat offenses trigger a private mediation session with the Scrum Master. | 
| Time conflict: Some members may not be able to complete the assignment on time due to part-time/other course tasks. | Early flagging of conflicts via Slack. Tasks are reassigned based on availability, and paired work sessions are scheduled to support overloaded members. |
| Uneven division of labor:Balance the workload of each member. | Weekly reviews are performed to rebalance the tasks, and the Scrum Master tries to balance the workload of each member when reassigning tasks. |
| Technical barriers: The team lacks experience with a particular technology required for the project. | Assign "Tech Buddies" (experienced members) to mentor others. Allocate 2 hours/week for team upskilling. |
### Responsibilities and Workload
| Potential issue  | Response |
|-------|-------|
| Group member(s) cannot meet a deadline  | Reassign tasks immediately with peer support. Conduct a retrospective to identify root causes (e.g., unclear requirements) and adjust future sprint planning. |
| Group member(s) are overburdened by workload | Visualize task distribution. Hold weekly check-ins to rebalance tasks and offer "flex hours" for members to swap responsibilities based on capacity. |
| Group member(s) are unclear role boundaries | Define role-specific responsibilities in Confluence. Scrum Master will clarify ambiguities during daily standups. |

Our team roles include:
| Role  | Name | Responsibilities e.g. Leading meetings, communicating with clients, proofreading, code review, specific deliverables, etc. Consider also who will be in charge of contacting team members and taking appropriate action if expectations are not met. |

| Quality Assurance Lead | Longfei Zhang | Implement testing frameworks, track bugs, and enforce code quality. |
| Development Environment Lead | Xingchen Li | Manage the development environment, manage Github and the development process. |

Our overall % contribution is expected to be 20/20/20/20/20

### Attendance and Participation
| Potential issue  | Response |
