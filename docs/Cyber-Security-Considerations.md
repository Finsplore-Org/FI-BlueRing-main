# Security Threats Overview

## Threats in AI Model

**Data Security**:  
- **Poisoning**: Malicious data corrupting training sets, affecting model performance.  
- **Exfiltration**: Theft of sensitive data during storage or transmission.  
- **Leakage**: Accidental exposure of private data through outputs or logs.

**Model Security**:  
- **Supply Chain Risks**: Compromised pre-trained models from untrusted sources.  
- **API Exploits**: Vulnerabilities in third-party APIs exposing systems to attack.  
- **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized access via misconfigured permissions.  
- **Intellectual Property Risks**: Unlicensed model content use leading to legal issues.

**Usage Security**:  
- **Prompt Injection**: Manipulating model behavior with crafted inputs.  
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Overloading services to cause unavailability.  
- **Model Theft**: Reconstructing or stealing the model by mining its outputs.

## Application/API Security Threats

- **Input Injection**: SQL Injection, Command Injection, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).  
- **Authentication Bypass**: Weak login mechanisms exploited for unauthorized access.  
- **Broken API Access Control**: Unauthorized access to endpoints due to poor API security.  
- **Excessive Data Exposure**: APIs revealing sensitive information, increasing breach risks.

# Secure Coding Practices

## 1. Input Validation

**Why**:  
To prevent injection attacks and application crashes.

**How**:
- Sanitize all inputs from users and external sources.
- Use whitelisting (allowed values) where possible.
- Validate both client-side and server-side.

---

## 2. Secure API Handling

**Why**:  
To avoid unauthorized access, data leaks, and misuse of APIs.

**How**:
- Authenticate every API request using JWTs or OAuth 2.0.
- Apply strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit user permissions.
- Rate limit and throttle API requests to defend against abuse and DoS attacks.

---

## 3. Authentication and Password Management

**Why**:  
To protect user identities and accounts.

**How**:
- Use strong hashing algorithms like `bcrypt` for password storage.
- Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- Implement secure session management (short session lifetimes, secure cookies).

---

## 4. Encryption

**Why**:  
To protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.

**How**:
- Use TLS 1.2 or above for encrypting data in transit.
- Encrypt sensitive data stored in databases.
- Secure secrets and keys using environment variables or secret management services.

---

## 5. Output Encoding

**Why**:  
To prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**How**:
- Escape and encode all dynamic outputs that are shown in the UI.
- Use frameworks that automatically sanitize outputs.

---

## 6. Error and Exception Handling

**Why**:  
To prevent information leakage that could help attackers.

**How**:
- Display generic error messages to users.
- Log detailed technical errors internally without exposing them to the client.
- Avoid leaking stack traces or database information.

---

## 7. Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention

**Why**:  
To defend against brute force attacks, credential stuffing, and DoS attacks.

**How**:
- Apply rate limiting to login endpoints and API requests.
- Monitor and block suspicious IP addresses.

---

## 8. Dependency and Supply Chain Security

**Why**:  
To prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

**How**:
- Regularly update dependencies.
- Use automated tools to scan for vulnerable packages (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot).
- Vet third-party models and packages before use.

# For AI Model Security

### 1. Data Security
- **Poisoning**: Injecting bad data to influence model behavior.
- **Leakage**: Accidental exposure of private information.

**Solutions**:
- Build a **Data Classification** tool (e.g., label datasets as sensitive or non-sensitive).
- Create a **simple encryption pipeline** to secure datasets before model training.
- Implement **basic access control policies** in a database or cloud storage.

---

### 2. Usage Security
- **Prompt Injection**: Malicious inputs trick models into behaving incorrectly.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Overloading the system with complex or repetitive prompts.

**Solutions**:
- Develop a **Prompt Filtering System** using regex or keyword matching.
- Build a **Prompt Injection Detector** using machine learning classification.
- Set **Guardrails** to restrict inputs that could lead to dangerous outputs.

---

### 3. Model Security
- **Supply Chain Risks**: Downloaded models could contain vulnerabilities.
- **License Risks**: Improper use of copyrighted materials.

**Solutions**:
- Create a **Model Vetting Checklist** app: verify sources, licenses, and basic properties before usage.
- Develop a **Model Scanner** to inspect metadata or hashes for integrity.

# Access Third-Party Libraries or APIs

1. **Evaluate Reputation**:  
   Check if the library/API is popular and has security reports.

2. **Review Licensing**:  
   Ensure the license is compatible with your project and doesn't impose restrictions.

3. **Follow Security Best Practices**:  
   Validate inputs, use HTTPS, and keep dependencies updated.

4. **Limit Scope**:  
   Only use whatâ€™s necessary and implement proper access controls.

5. **Test the Integration**:  
   Test the library/API and check for dependency issues.

6. **Monitor for Updates**:  
   Regularly check for updates or security patches.
