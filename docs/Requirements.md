## App Startup Time
- **Cold Start:** App launch time should be **< 2s**.  
- **Warm Start:** App resumes from background in **< 500ms**.  
- **Optimization:**  
  - Lazy loading for non-essential components.  
  - Minimize bundle size using tree shaking.(vite or webpack)

## API Response Time
- **Max Response Time:** API calls should complete within **< 500ms**.  
- **Caching:** strong cache and negotiate cache.

# Availability (Uptime & Reliability)

## Server live time
To ensure the app is always available, the server should have **99.99% uptime**, meaning it can only be down for **a maximum of 52.6 minutes per year**. This helps users access the app without frequent disruptions.  

# Security

## Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth 2.0 & JWT:** Secure user login using **OAuth 2.0** and **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for session management, google oauth.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Restrict access to sensitive financial data based on user roles.

## Data Protection and Encrption
- **HTTPS:** All communications between the app and the server must use **HTTPS** to prevent data interception.
- **AES Encryption:** Store sensitive user data (e.g., passwords, financial transactions) using **AES-256 encryption**.

## XSS & SQLIA & CSPF protection
**make sure never use user's input as code.**
- **SQL Injection:** Use **parameterized queries** to prevent database attacks.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Sanitize user inputs and use **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to block malicious scripts code.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Implement **CSRF tokens** to protect user actions from unauthorized requests.

# Compatibility

To ensure the app works seamlessly across different devices, platforms, and API versions, we focus on the following areas:

## Cross-Platform Compatibility (iOS & Android)
- **Multiple Platforms Support:** Ensure the app is compatible with both **iOS** and **Android** devices, maintaining a consistent user experience across both operating systems.

## API Versioning
- **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure that the API can support **older app versions**, allowing users to interact with the system without issues when updating to newer versions.
- **Semantic Versioning:** Use **semantic versioning** for the API (e.g., `v1`, `v2`) to clearly indicate breaking or non-breaking changes, ensuring app versions can still communicate with the API correctly.
