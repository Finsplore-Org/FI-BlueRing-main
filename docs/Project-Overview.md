## Project Goal/ expected outcome
Finsplore is a smart, user-focused financial assistant built to help people take control of their finances through automation, personalization, and clear, actionable insights. It's designed to address a common challenge—juggling complex financial information from different sources while trying to make smart decisions for long-term financial health.

At the core of Finsplore is a powerful AI system made up of two key components: the Agent and the Advisor. The Agent handles real-time interactions, giving users quick access to important information like upcoming bills or recent transactions. Meanwhile, the Advisor plays a more strategic role, analyzing spending habits and financial patterns to offer personalized recommendations. The goal is to help users make better budgeting decisions, build stronger financial habits, and boost overall financial resilience.

The experience starts with a smooth onboarding process where users can easily register and verify their identity. After logging in, they can connect their bank accounts through the Consumer Data Right (CDR) framework. This allows Finsplore to securely pull in live data from multiple accounts and give users a clear, unified view of their finances—including assets, debts, and transaction history.

One of the core features is the Categorisation and Visualisation dashboard. Transactions are automatically sorted into categories using AI, so users can quickly see where their money is going. They can also fine-tune these categories to match their preferences. The dashboard includes interactive charts and timelines to help users track income and expenses, set financial goals, and stay on top of their progress.

But what really sets Finsplore apart is its ability to turn data into meaningful guidance. The AI doesn’t just present numbers—it delivers helpful nudges, timely advice, and detailed responses to natural language questions like “How much did I spend on groceries last month?” It’s all about giving users the right information at the right time so they can make confident, informed choices.

Overall, Finsplore shows how AI can be used to create financial tools that are not just smart, but also transparent, ethical, and truly helpful. It’s a step toward making financial wellbeing more accessible and empowering people to build healthier money habits in today’s digital world.
