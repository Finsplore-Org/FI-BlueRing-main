- [ ] *All*-**Document ChatGPT/AI usage clearly**, including prompts and outputs (for transparency & rubric).
- [ ] *Wenxi Deng*-**Use Fibonacci story points** (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) to estimate task effort, not time.
- [ ] *All*-**Break down tasks based on user stories**, e.g., separate backend endpoint vs. frontend UI.
- [ ] *Wenxi Deng & Xinxin Guo*-**Keep updating Figma prototype** based on client feedback & document validation outcomes.

## Mentor Meeting 05

**Location:** Zoom  
**Date:** Monday, 28 April  
**Time:** 3:00 PM – 3:30 PM  

## Attendees
- Wenxi Deng

- Can Wang
- Xingchen Li
- Longfei Zhang
- Akassharjun Shanmugarajah (Mentor)

## Agenda

### 1. Stand-Up Updates
- **Xinxin Guo**: Completed backend setup and connected to the database. Documented ethical and security considerations in the Wiki. Waiting for Basiq API to proceed further.
- **Wenxi Deng**: Working on integrating Basiq API with the backend. Successfully created and stored Basiq user IDs in the database and progressing towards enabling transaction data access.
- **Can Wang**: Researched AI models and worked on resolving inconsistencies in user story cases. Continued exploring fine-tuning strategies for AI model deployment.

### 2. Technical Clarifications & Feedback
- Cybersecurity & Ethics:These sections have been moved to Sprint 3. Team should wait for the upcoming lecture before deep-diving.

- Backend successfully integrated with Basiq API to fetch transaction data
- Displayed transaction data in the mobile frontend
- Discussed integration of Basiq user IDs
- Shared partial chatbot interaction

#### 2. ID Verification Clarification

- Team to defer full verification process but record ID as part of user onboarding

#### 3. AI Model Architecture & Privacy Concerns
- Team discussed use of AI to convert user input to SQL queries
- Client confirmed:
  - Sensitive user data **must not** be sent to external APIs
