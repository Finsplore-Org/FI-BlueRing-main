In developing our application, we have carefully considered the ethical implications of our project. We focused on key areas including privacy, transparency, inclusivity, and sustainability.

# Ethical Concerns

## Privacy

Since we are handling sensitive financial information, protecting user privacy is a top priority. We plan to encrypt all personal and financial data both during transfer and while stored. Only authorized services will have access to user data, and users will have the right to control and delete their information at any time. Our project also follows the privacy principles set out by the Consumer Data Right (CDR) framework in Australia.

## Transparency

We believe users should clearly understand how their data is collected and used. Our application will explain:
- What financial data we are accessing
- How the AI classifies transactions
- How insights and advice are generated

The chatbot will not make decisions for users — it will only provide recommendations based on the data users choose to share.

## Inclusivity

We aim to design a system that is easy to use for people with different backgrounds and levels of financial knowledge. We will use simple, clear language in both the app interface and chatbot responses. We will also make sure the app is accessible to users with diverse needs, as much as possible within the project’s scope.

## Sustainability

Although our app’s environmental impact is relatively small, we are still mindful of sustainability. We will aim to use cloud services that are energy efficient and write optimized code to reduce unnecessary processing.
